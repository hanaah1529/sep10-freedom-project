                                  <p class="card-text">To start off the term “pharmacy” was referred to as apothecary.
                                    Before advanced technology pharmacies operated with dispensing prescriptions in a tablet or capsule form with a simple tray and spatula.
                                    During Ancient Mesopotamia,they would use clay tablets to write pharmaceutical texts and some of these were indicating things like formulas,instructions,infusion,boiling,filtering and spreading and herbs.
                                     Fast forward today now we have a lot of advanced technology compared to hundreds of years ago where pharmacies now have the access to the devices of software and hardware that can help drug manufacturing go faster and smoother and also monitor the safety of patients.
                                    This also has benefits such as reducing cost and gaining efficiency while also decreasing manual labor/input.
                                    An example of another hardware of technology that pharmacies use is called the “automated dispensing cabinets”.They are decentralized medication systems with the purpose to give computer-controlled storage,dispensing, and tracking of drugs for patient care units and also to improve inventory control through tracking.
